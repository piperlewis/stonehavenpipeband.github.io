			<p class="about_text">Our History of the band starts with <span style="color: #993399">Pipe Major George McDonald</span>, the founder of the Stonehaven Pipe Band.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="about_text">Pipe Major George McDonald spent his early days with his grandparents at Finzean. Later, after leaving school, he entered the postal service at Stonehaven. With a keen interest in the <span style="color: #993399">Great Highland Bagpipe</span>, he joined the <span style="color: #993399">5th Volunteer Battalion</span> of the <span style="color: #993399">Gordon Highlanders</span> (Deeside) on the 21st December 1892. In <span style="color: #993399">1905</span>, he was promoted to Pipe Major of the 5th Battalion and when the <span style="color: #993399">1/7th (Deeside Highland) Battalion</span> was formed he immediately transferred and formed the <span style="color: #993399">Stonehaven Pipe Band</span>.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="about_text">In <span style="color: #993399">August 1914</span>, the band, alongside the Rector of Mackie Academy Major 'Billie' Riddochâ€™s <span style="color: #993399">'D' Company 1/7th</span>, marched from Stonehaven to Banchory as a Battalion before proceeding to Bedford for further training. In May <span style="color: #993399">1915</span>, they set off for <span style="color: #993399">France</span>, little knowing what was awaiting them.</p>
			<br>  
			<p class="about_text">After the war, Pipe Major McDonald played a major role in reforming a <span style="color: #993399">territorial company</span> at Stonehaven and a strong <span style="color: #993399">Pipe Band</span>. The latter performed at many civil and military, including the unveiling of the <span style="color: #993399">Aberdeen War Memorial</span> and several other engagements in Kincardineshire. When the Battalion Headquarters was transferred to Bucksburn, Pipe Major McDonald retired. After his <span style="color: #993399">37-years</span> tenure, he was succeeded by one of his younger student pipers, Pipe Major George Cruickshank, himself a famous and successful solo piper in his day.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="about_text">As of 2020, Pipe Major McDonald has since been succeeded by a further <span style="color: #993399">15 Pipe Majors</span>, all following in his extremely large brogues!</p>
			<br>
			<p class="about_text">Although the traditions and goals of the Pipe Band have remained the same over the years, the <span style="color: #993399">tartan has changed</span>. The first tartan, the <span style="color: #993399">Hunting Gordon</span>, was the local tartan worn by the Gordon Highlanders. This changed to <span style="color: #993399">The Royal Stewart</span> in 1965 when the Stewart family took charge of the band. In 1987, the tartan worn was once again changed, this time to <span style="color: #993399">Stewart of Appin</span>. 1998 has, to date, seen the last change and the band currently wears the <span style="color: #993399">Modern Red Robertson tartan</span>. The main reason for the change in tartan is largely due to wear and tear - an unavoidable outcome when most weekends are spent performing in all weathers, Summer and Winter.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="about_text">The Band joined the <span style="color: #993399">Royal Scottish Pipe Band Association</span> and began to compete, first locally and then further afield. Their first major success came in <span style="color: #993399">1980</span> in the form of <span style="color: #993399">Grade 4 European Champions</span>, under the leadership of Pipe Major Raymond Whyte.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="about_text">Then, under the leadership of <span style="color: #993399">Pipe Major Brian Elrick</span>, there was no looking back. The band went from strength to strength and up the grades to the Premier grade, in world pipe band competition, <span style="color: #993399">Grade 1</span>. During this time, band members came from as far afield as Forres in the North and Kirriemuir and Kirkcaldy in the South. These dedicated musicians travelled twice weekly to practice, some completing round trips of <span style="color: #993399">over 200 miles</span> on each occasion. Achieving first and second place in Grade 4 quartets and full band competitions.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="about_text">Now in 2020, Stonehaven Pipe Band continues its legacy in promoting <span style="color: #993399">great music</span>, staying true and close to its community with a <span style="color: #993399">passion</span> for playing.</p>
